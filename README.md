# Digital Identity Document (DID) Risk Assessment Project

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive cybersecurity risk assessment for a national Digital Identity Document (DID) renewal system. The analysis was conducted as part of an academic case study to evaluate threats, vulnerabilities, and impacts on critical business assets associated with the DID ecosystem.

## Project Scope

The system involves several entities:
- **Town Halls** – Manage renewal application processing and citizen data.
- **DIDMC (DID Management Company)** – Responsible for DID printing and distribution.
- **TAC (Technical Administration Company)** – Maintains the Information System for DID renewal.
- **HeberWeb** – Provides cloud hosting services.
- **NAMD** – Defines characteristics of DIDs.
- **Citizens** – Owners of sensitive personal data involved in the system.

## Objectives

- Identify and assess risks affecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of DID-related assets.
- Define potential attack scenarios and threat actors (e.g., foreign states, hacktivists, rogue employees).
- Propose technical and organizational security measures to mitigate identified risks.
- Support system accreditation and compliance with **ISO 27001:2013**, **ISO 9001:2015**, and **GDPR** requirements.

## Methodology

The risk analysis follows structured steps inspired by the **EBIOS Risk Manager** methodology:
- Asset identification
- Ecosystem and stakeholder mapping
- Threat modeling and feared event analysis
- Attack scenario formulation
- Risk evaluation and mitigation proposal

## Key Security Measures Proposed

- Network segmentation and secure system partitioning
- Role-based access control and least privilege principle
- HTTPS, SSH with key-based authentication, and MFA
- Physical access controls and visitor management
- Secure data handling and IT equipment lifecycle management
- Logging, monitoring, and incident response mechanisms

## Outcomes

The study highlighted critical areas of risk including potential data breaches, service disruption, and GDPR infringements. Countermeasures were proposed to minimize risk likelihood without altering severity (as target objectives remain unchanged). The assessment supports the accreditation and operational security of the DID system.
